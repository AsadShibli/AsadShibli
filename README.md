### Hi there, it's Asad 👋 (MD. Asadullah Shibli)
#### Data Scientist | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Python Developer

 Having passion for machine learning, deep learning, and embedded systems drives me to seek out new challenges and opportunities to apply my knowledge and ideas. I believe that every project is a chance to learn something new and gain valuable experience, whether through success or failure. Ultimately, satisfaction comes from the process of discovery and growth that occurs along the way.
